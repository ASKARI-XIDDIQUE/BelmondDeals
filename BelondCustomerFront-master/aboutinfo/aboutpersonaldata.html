        <h4>Understanding and evaluating how, when and why people are using platform for the purposes of delivering, evaluating, improving and optimising the delivery of our services. For example: monitoring the numbers of users who redirect to, or make bookings with, Travel Suppliers and details of the related travel options being selected for the purposes of commercial records and business analytics; analysing at an aggregate level what different groups of users may be viewing or clicking on within our services in order to better understand which features or functionality are more popular or helpful than others; reviewing and moderating any User Content that you upload to the our Services; running A/B tests that display alternate versions of our services to different groups of users, in order to evaluate the positive or negative impact of such changes on our users' experience of our services. For example, we may change the prominence of a button, its colour or its placement for different users visiting our site to help us understand how to make our service easier to use or to more effectively draw users' attention to the most relevant and important information; and measuring the effectiveness of our communications through recording and analysing whether emails we have sent you have been opened.</h4>
        <h4>Personalising your experience of our services in order to ensure your experience on platformis as helpful, efficient and relevant as possible. For example: we will use cookies to remember your language and currency preferences and may also personalise your experience by highlighting or recommending certain information or travel options that we believe are relevant to you based on your search history and use of our services; if you have asked us to send you newsletters or other marketing communications, we may tailor the timings or content of these to reflect what we believe will be of most interest to you, such as by using the fact that you've recently searched for a flight in Barcelona to prompt us to ask whether you'd like to search for a hotel in Barcelona as well; we may use your location information to predict which airport you are likely to want to depart from or arrive back to; and displaying relevant advertisements to you about our services or other services that we think may be of interest to you. For example, where we know that you've recently searched for a flight to a given location, we may display a message to you asking whether you'd like to search for a hotel or car in the same location. See the How is your information used for advertising? section below for more information.</h4>
        <h4>Personalising your experience involves us creating a profile and timeline of your activity on our services. However, we are careful to ensure that our activities do not involve undertaking any profiling or automated decision making that might have any legal or other significant effects on you.</h4>
        <h4>We may use your data to train our machine learning algorithms to help us personalise the Services. We will not use directly identifying information such as your contact details or payment data for these purposes.</h4>
        <h4>Informing strategic business decisions through creating aggregated datasets of anonymised data that allow us to generate helpful insights into patterns or trends within the travel industry. For example, we can use search data to monitor demand for destinations and make sure that the fares and travel options that we surface to our users are available via our services. This information is also useful for Travel Suppliers as it enables them to identify new routes or locations that are in demand and ensure they are delivering competitive rates. Contacting you in order to invite you to participate in genuine market research.</h4>
        <h4>Where we process your personal data based on a legitimate interest we will only do so where the processing is relevant, adequate and limited to what is necessary for the purpose it was collected for. And of course, we'll always ensure our legitimate interests don't unfairly impact on your own rights and freedoms.</h4>
        <h4>When we have your consent We will obtain your consent for purposes such as:
        <br>•	Sending you emails for services you request such as Price Alerts;
        <br>•	Sending you direct marketing communications via email, push notification or other means where you have consented to us doing so;
        <br>•	Storing certain cookies on your device, where doing so requires consent; and
        <br>•	Recording and evaluating feedback you give us where you agree to take part in one-to-one user testing.
        <br>•	Where we process your personal data based only on your consent, you can withdraw this consent at any time either

            MOMONDO  LTD,  
            This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. Our Privacy Policy for Accor LTD is managed through Free Privacy Policy Website.
                    </h4>
        <h4>
            Along with our Terms of Service and Cookie Policy, this policy explains how we collect and handle your information across all of our websites, mobile apps and other services. We'll review this policy from time to time to make sure it's up-to-date. If we make changes, we'll post the latest version here. When we make significant changes, we'll let you know when you next access our services, or by other communications.    </h4>
    <h4>
        Learn more about this policy
You'll come across the term 'personal data' a lot in this policy. By that, we mean any information relating to you as an identifiable individual. For example, this includes information that may of itself identify you such as your name, contact details, trip itinerary, internet protocol ("IP") address, cookie strings or device IDs, as well as information that may not on its own identify you, but which we store alongside such identifiers, such as how you are using our services or the country you are in when you do so.
We can only speak for ourselves so this policy doesn't cover the collection or use of your information by any of the airlines, online travel agents, hotels, car hire companies or other travel companies (let's call them "Travel Suppliers") we feature. That means when you make a booking with a Travel Supplier, your information will be processed by them in accordance with their own privacy policy and terms and conditions. But don't worry, we'll always give you the links so you can read them before making a booking.
We only use your information where you've given us your consent, where its necessary to deliver the services you've requested, where it's necessary to exercise or comply with legal rights or obligations, or for normal business purposes of the kind set out in this policy.
Learn more about why and how we use your personal data
When we need to do so to deliver our services or facilitate the performance of a contract you've entered - or are entering - into, such as making a booking with us or a Travel Supplier.
How we use personal data to perform contracts.
1)	Ensuring our services are accessible and usable by you on your specific device, for example by altering the way we display information to you based on your device type; <br>
2)	Generating results in response to your search queries, for example providing you with a list of the flight, hotel or car-hire options that best meet your requirements; <br>
3)	Where you select a Travel Supplier that you'd like to make a booking with either: <br>
4)	redirecting you to their platform along with whatever data is necessary to enable them to recognise you and the travel option you had selected on Momondo , including data about your browser or device and the details of your travel search; or facilitating the completion of that booking from within our services, which will involve us collecting and transferring to that Travel Supplier all information required to enable the booking to be processed, including your contact details, passport or identification information, and payment details; <br>
5)	Contacting you with messages, notifications or alerts that are necessary in order to deliver our services requested, such as booking confirmation emails or other essential communications like flight status alerts and notifications about changes or updates to our services or to this policy, our Cookie Policy or our Terms of Service; <br>
6)	Responding to communications you have sent us, such as via our customer service help centre or on social media; <br>
7)	Displaying reviews, images and any other content and media you submit to platform or upload to the our Services (we'll call this "User Content"), and providing you with the tools to manage and delete this content; <br>
8)	Where you have created an account with us, maintaining and administering this and ensuring that it is kept up-to-date and accessible; <br>
To improve or optimise our services and to otherwise protect or further our legitimate interests. This includes pretty serious reasons like fraud prevention and security but also fun ones like product enhancement so we can keep making our platfrom even better for our travellers.
